# 21Day-SQL-Challenge
This is a sql challenge organised by Indian Data Club sponsered by DpDZero,where I revisited the SQL fndamentas and applied them in solving real world problems.This challenge gave me a great opportunity to refresh,revise and strengthen my sql skills through consistent hands on practice.

Even though I had learned SQL earlier, this challenge pushed me to rebuild discipline and consistency.

➡️ **There were days when I missed submitting the challenge**,
➡️ **And there were days when I sat for 2–3 hours straight** working to solve the queries.

But showing up again the next day made all the difference.
This challenge felt **real**, **challenging**, and **deeply rewarding**.



### **💡 What I Gained from This Challenge**

✔ Strengthened SQL fundamentals
✔ Improved analytical & problem-solving skills

### **📂 Projects I Worked On**
